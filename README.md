# Bank-ATM
This was the first personal project undertaken during the completion of an Udemy Java Course that was started during the summer before my MSc. 
I wanted to test and help solidify the understanding of Javaâ€™s Object Orientated Programming (OOP) concept. After some research online I decided to create a Bank ATM. 
This software creates a new User with their own details, a unique randomised user number and a user set pin code. 
It allows the user to create several accounts then deposit, withdraw and transfer funds between those accounts, showing the balance and transaction history. 
I found this particularly useful in understanding OOP and develop my programming skills.
